This is a OSX Spritekit game created as part of a two day hackathon. It was used as part of a competition. The player with the highest score would win a smartphone. 

# BRNImagePickerSheet

## About
BRNImagePickerSheet is a duplicate of that shiny new custom action sheet seen in iOS8's iMessage that Apple didn't make part of UIKit. It's the first project I've written in Swift. It works well but I might have coded something the Objective-C kind of way. Don't hesitate to open an issue/ pullrequest if you spotted something.
